Java is a programming language developed by the Green Project Team of the Sun Microsystems, headed by James Gosling, in the late 1990â€™s. Perhaps the most prominent reason why Java became so successful is that it was the first programming language which was not chained to one operating system. Java is designed to be platform independent. Never before did any language posses such a remarkable feature.
